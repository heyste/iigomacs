#+TITLE: Taking Spac(emacs), Go and the ii workflow on the Road

An initial start at getting various technologies together with the ii workflow so it's easy to explore them on more systems.

Warning: The container is large! approx ~4GB. Depending on your machine and internet connection it may take some time to build the docker container.

* Usage:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git clone https://github.com/heyste/iigomacs
  cd iigomacs
  ./boot.sh
#+END_SRC

/Note: You will need to clean up any old docker containers/images./
